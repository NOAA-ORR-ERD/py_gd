Using VCPKG on Windows.

Starting from here:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-vscode?source=recommendations&pivots=shell-cmd


### bootstrap vcpkg

Set the PATH, for me that's:

set PATH=%VCPKG_ROOT%;%PATH%
set "VCPKG_ROOT=C:\Users\Chris.Barker\Documents\vcpkg"

## set up install

vcpkg new --application
vcpkg add port pkgconf vcpkg-cmake vcpkg-cmake-config libgd

vcpkg install

#### Failure:
```

# Notes from: 
notes about vcpkg from:

https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD/py_gd/pull/27

## Install libgd

Clone vcpkg repository in repo folder and start vcpkg.

git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git

# NOTE: --depth 1  would likely make sense
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

Install libgd. The default location is at vcpkg\installed\x64-windows. It takes
about half of an hour. This will download and prepare all the dependencies (.h
and .lib).

vcpkg install libgd --triplet=x64-windows

this failed for me :-(
