colormaps.py

Assorted colormaps you can use with py_gd

To see what they all are::

  print(py_gd.colors.colorscheme_names)

To access a particular one::

  py_gd.colors.colorscheme[name]

NOTE: there are both discrete and continuous colorschemes provided


To Do: a function to create a py_gd colormap from MPL colormaps
       directly
