Sample Scripts
==============

A good way to learn to use py_gd is to check out a few example scripts.



Ultra Simple Example
--------------------

About the simplest example for py_gd

This draws a red line at a diagonal across an image.

Using a Color Ramp
------------------

Example of how to use a colorramp

In this case, we plot a "Heatmap" of a surface from the equation:

z = sin(x) + sin(y)

Smooth Polygon
--------------

This example draws a star with rounded points, with varying roundedness.

It uses a "Spline Polygon:
