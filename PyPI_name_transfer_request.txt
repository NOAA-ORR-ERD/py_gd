In order to attempt a name transfer of the "py-gd" name on PyPI, I attempted to contact the author via and issue on the gitHub project:

https://github.com/kilfu0701/py-gd/issues/1

and an email to:

kilfu0701@gmail.com

NOTE: kilfu0701's account on gitHUb had activity as of Jan 25, 2023 -- so hopefully I'll get a response.

Note that niether the PyPI project or the gitHub project have had any activity since 2018 (and only a start up in 2018 -- not much there). It doesn't look like this ws every a "useful" project on PyPI.

PyPi stats indicates:

Downloads last day: 0
Downloads last week: 1
Downloads last month: 8

With a max of 6 in one day in the last 7 months ....
I suspect those are all some sort of mirror or analytics, or ..

In contrast, my lat-lon-parser project, which I don't think is very well known:

Downloads last day: 4,658
Downloads last week: 42,644
Downloads last month: 146,580

88 hmm, maybe it is being used!

and pynucos:

Downloads last day: 2
Downloads last week: 162
Downloads last month: 584

NOTE that that one is available on conda-forge, and mostly used by our other packages that are onlyl available on conda-forge


# The email I sent:


I found your project on PyPI:

https://pypi.org/project/py-gd/

However, it looks like there was an initial upload Dec 5 2028, and nothing since then.

And the github repo doesn't seem to have any use since then, either.

Since this isn't in use, I'm hoping you'd be willing to transfer the name on PyPI to me for my py-gd project:

https://github.com/NOAA-ORR-ERD/py_gd

My project is under active development, and has been on conda-forge with the "py_gd" name for years:

https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/py_gd

(note that pip and PyPI "normalize" names, so that py_gd and py-gd are the same)

I hadn't put it on PyPI earlier, because it's a hard to build binary package -- but with modern cibuildwheel, it's now time.

It would be nice if I could use the name I'm already using on conda-forge and github, and the import name itself.

Thanks,

-CHB
